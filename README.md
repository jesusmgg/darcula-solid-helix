# Darcula Solid for Helix
A dark, comfortable to the eyes with good contrast for the [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) editor.

*This theme is now officially included in the Helix repository:*
*https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/runtime/themes/darcula-solid.toml. Because of this, development continues there and this repository is being archived.*
